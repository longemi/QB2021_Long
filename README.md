My name is Emily Long and something you might not know about me is I was part of NCAA Women Swimming and Diving national championship team while at Auburn in 2007. I have a really cool ring :). I was also an Olympic trial qualifier in the 100 M breaststroke. I grew up in Atlanta Georgia where swimming was a huge part of my life. In high school I would get up at 4 AM for a 5 AM practice and then go back in the afternoon for a second practice. I still follow the sport closely but have swam enough laps in my life! I know enjoy running and strength training.
